    'I\'m a programmer who enjoys building things from the ground up. Mostly, I make websites, but I also have some experience with C++ and Python. I like working on both front-end and back-end code, and I often create my own tools and systems instead of relying on big frameworks. However, I also use Laravel with Vue for more complex web apps. I have the most experience with JavaScript.',

    'I enjoy experimenting with mathematical functions, fractals, audio, signal processing, and other interesting problems. I\'m also interested in graphics programming, so I sometimes play around with WebGL. At one point, I even started coding a Minecraft clone in vanilla JavaScript. I began the project quite some time ago and learned a lot from it. It\'s a big project, and even though I\'m not working on it right now, I plan to return to it someday.',

    'Music is another interest of mine. I play instruments such as piano and electric guitar, and I practice almost every day. I like experimenting with different effects for the electric guitar and discovering new tones. Recently, I started learning how to create my own music using a DAW.',

    'Besides programming and music, I\'m also into electronics. I like building circuits and learning how different electronic components work. Sometimes, I also use premade circuits, such as audio amplifiers. In the future, I might start working with microcontrollers as well. One of my goals is to build my own guitar effect pedals.',
